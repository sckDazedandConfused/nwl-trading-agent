    The first step toward more profitable investing is to accept that market irrationality is due to the fact that people make decisions based on (unavoidably) incomplete information, which often results in the worst decisions being made when it is most important to be right.

    Human nature is such that we tend to overweight information that supports our presupposed inclinations. We seek out a few pieces of the bigger picture that make us feel confident in our decisions. This recurring overconfidence is behind the idea that markets are “irrational in a predictable manner,” a landmark theory put forth by Nobel Prize-winning psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

    and how, within that structure, predictability manifests itself in recognizable forms such as the “excess” that occurs at the end of an auction. We show you how excess is formed, too, and how to view it objectively in order to better manage risk.

    Everyone talks about the problems of investing and market behavior. We are proposing a solution, a means of interpreting market behavior through the lens of human consciousness, and then quantifying that information in a way that enables investing on a more probabilistic basis.

    The core idea is simple: all financial markets are measurable by time, price, and volume. This multidimensional approach to interpreting market-generated information enables you to differentiate between prices, because all prices are not equal. By extension, all opportunities are not equal, which is key in managing the probabilities of risk.

    Successful timeframe diversification can help hedge against the major liquidating breaks, short-covering rallies, and other short-term market movements caused by news events that can push markets to the breaking point. What I’m getting at is that managers often throw in the towel at exactly the wrong time. This is undoubtedly why there’s a saying that markets will trade to levels that cause the most pain for the greatest number of investors.

    We should expect, considering a general understanding of human nature, that the larger the horse’s lead, the more individuals will place bets on that horse to win, and that bets on the horse in the back of the pack will evaporate. When you extrapolate this behavior in the context of financial markets, is it really so “irrational”? When you think about it, betting on a clear winner is a pretty rational decision, in the immediacy of the moment. This phenomenon is commonly known as “momentum investing,” which is often the primary force behind short-term market movement. And just as the payoff odds decrease in a betting pool as more money is placed upon a particular entry, the payoff odds decrease for late-momentum investors as the market explores price extremes.

    THE AUCTIONS Auctions are made up of three fundamental elements: price, time, and volume. Price is simply the auction’s means of advertising opportunity. Time regulates each opportunity, and volume measures the degree of success of each auction. As with any auction, there are goods for sale, bidders attempting to buy, and sellers trying to sell. While price is the mechanism used to fairly distribute goods among participants, the skew of volume and prices enables us to see how willing or unwilling the participants were to either acquire or give up their holdings; some will be willing to relinquish their goods at fair value, while others will only enter the auction process if they perceive price to be away from fair value. As in all successful financial endeavors, it quickly becomes clear that not all prices are equal, and that identifying the “fair value” consensus is pivotal in understanding the underlying forces at work in any given market (Warren Buffett has been saying this for years). A market profile, by its very nature, helps identify price in relationship to value.

    On one day, sellers are discouraged by prices below value, and buyers are discouraged by prices above value. When both sides have essentially established a “value area,” any movement away from value will serve to shut off the flow of auction activity until price returns to equilibrium. This is commonly known as reversion to the mean. On another day, the same market may find that divergences from value—higher or lower prices—actually attract more volume rather than shutting it off, which forces participants to reassess their idea of value (investors who trade via reversion to the mean will be unable to sustain profitability when divergences from value are successful).

    Notice that the value area represents approximately one standard deviation. This distinction enables you to distinguish price from value, the most fundamental principle of investing. When price occurs within the value area, price and value are considered to be the same. When price occurs outside the value area, price is considered to be away from value. Regardless of your timeframe, as price moves away from the value area, there will either be acceptance of the move—witnessed by TPOs accumulating at the new level, which effectively changes the shape of Profile and shifts the value area—or rejection, in which case price will return to the value area with little change in the volume distribution. Trends occur when price movements result in value-area migration. Bracketing markets are revealed when price movements continually revert to a consistent value area, containing price within well-defined parameters that can last for months.

Recalling how we calculated the value area, by summing the volume both above and below the high volume area (referred to as the point of control, or POC), you will see that the POC was moving lower over the course of the 27 days, which signifies that the value area was being forced lower. Without the multidimensional view (time, price, and volume), what was really occurring in this market might have been masked by hype; the experts, especially the CNN analysts, were all reporting high odds for a Santa Claus rally—defined as the trading period between Christmas and New Year’s. You couldn’t turn on the television without seeing some pundit announcing the inevitable rally. But if such a rally were really imminent, the point of control should have been rising, not falling.

    The Market Profile is a powerful tool for capturing the structure of the market as it is being built. While Figure 2.1 resembles a normal bell curve, Figure 2.4 reveals a volume that skews toward the bottom of the profile. Price alone cannot distinguish between a market in which movements away from value will be retraced, versus a market that is transitioning from bracketing to trending or from trending to bracketing. Sophisticated traders—defined as those that survive and prosper over the long haul—quickly adapt to different strategies depending on the bracket/ trend bifurcation. Investors that incorporate market-generated information effectively increase the odds that they can determine whether the current market action is occurring within the context of an intermediate or longer-term bracket, or as part of a trend. The strategies for each of these two types of markets are quite different, which we will discuss at length in later chapters.

    It is worth noting that over the years a substantial number of well-known researchers and economists have failed to recognize the importance of volume distribution among timeframes—as well as the relevance of the very existence of different timeframes. For example, a respected economist recently suggested that it is obvious that there is “a buyer for every seller and a seller for every buyer.” While it may be obvious that every sale comes with a corresponding purchase, what many fail to grasp is the relevance of which timeframes are behind the buying and selling. This powerful piece of knowledge unlocks key information about the potential for future directional movement.

    example of fifteenth century landscape?”). As markets conduct their business through continuous two-way auctions, declining price on increasing volume is bearish, and decreasing volume is either neutral or bullish. The final analysis of any given auction or trading day is highly dependent upon the variance-from-mean volume. Remember, the principles we have discussed are applicable for all timeframes. This can be extremely confusing until you learn to identify which timeframes are active. For example, if the markets are demonstrating intermediate-term balance, as well as short-term balance, volume is likely to be of lesser importance to the long-term trader. However, should the market approach or break out of either of the extremes of the intermediate-term range, the long-term investor /trader would definitely be concerned with volume. Most serious traders and investors are familiar with the term “regression to mean.” This simple concept is at the core of the current discussion—attempted breakouts that result in decreasing volume are likely to see price revert back toward the mean. Attempted breakouts that result in increasing volume, however, reveal that new, aggressive participants have entered the market. In these circumstances, new value areas are likely to be established for all timeframes.

    We have continually stressed the importance of context. The following examination of attempted direction is no exception. The first step in properly assessing the relevance of volume is to determine which direction the market was attempting to auction when that volume was established—an assessment that can often be difficult. If the attempted direction cannot be determined, then it is not wise to make a volume assessment; the market was probably balanced, and the auctions rotated relatively equally between high and low.

    But let’s consider a more complex example, one in which a stock rallies to new highs, breaking 100 for the first time. Experts go on record saying they’ll buy the stock on a correction. Most investors assume that a “correction” in this context would mean a decline in prices after the stock’s rally. While such a dip could occur, the “correction” does not necessarily have to result in lower prices—new long-term buyers could enter the market, buying from short-term sellers and keeping the price from falling. This activity effectively relieves holders of old long positions of their merchandise, replacing them with new long-term buyers.

    once a new auction gets underway, multiple participants bid for supply. At lower prices, only a few bids may be filled—the auction rises quickly if prices are perceived as unfair (below value) for sellers of a certain timeframe. As price auctions higher, more bids are accepted and some bidders drop out as prices exceed their idea of fair value. From there on, only those that must buy to meet demand, or those caught up in the auction frenzy, continue to purchase inventory as price climbs higher. Once market participants sense that prices, for their timeframe, have auctioned above value, and that demand is waning, then offers begin to exceed bids and an auction begins in the opposite direction.

    If you look at the two periods marked “Balancing,” you will observe that the market began the balancing process several months prior to the completion of the absolute highs and lows for the respective long-term trends. Often, it is not until the balancing process is already underway that you realize the long-term auction is ending and the market is coming into equilibrium.

    Long-term auctions are comprised of several such intermediate-term auctions, and provide important context without which trade decisions can get lost in day-to-day information overload.

    May 2003 was chosen as the “upside breakout” because the market had given up probing below these significant reference points. Following the upside breakout, the market again balanced—or “bracketed”—for 11 months before continuing onward.

    Brackets arise out of the market’s innate need to balance. When price is perceived to be away from value, the market auctions in one direction until a new value level is found. This happens within the day, day-to-day, week-to-week, and longer timeframes. As observers, we only know that a new value level has been found when two-sided trade begins to take place; the market begins to auction in both directions with relatively equal strength, always pulled back to a central value, known in statistical circles as “the mean.” The tighter the extremes of the bracket, the closer the perceptions of value between buyers and sellers of all timeframes. The farther apart, the more differing opinions are in play.

    Another way to illustrate this concept is to think of a trend as a market that is “unfair” to one side. For example, in an upward trend, the market is telling us that prices are too low—unfair for the seller. In a bracketing period, the market is expressing its belief that prices are once again fair for both the long-term seller as well as the long-term buyer. The resulting activity is a relatively well-defined area of price containment, often characterized by overlapping value areas. As long as
